#### Interfaces

| Module Interfaces | RAK3172 |
| :---------------- | :------ |
| UART2/LPUART1     | UART1   |

#### Sub-GHz SPI interface

A dedicated internal SPI interface called SUBGHZSPI is used to communicate with the RF subsystem of the STM32WLE5CCU6.

#### Pin Definition

**warning**
When using RF pin for antenna and not the IPEX connector variant, there are design considerations to make sure optimum RF performance.

*   RF traces must be away from interference (switching nodes of DC-DC supplies, high current/voltage pulses from controllers of inductive loads like motors, signal generators, etc.).
*   RF traces must have 50 Ohm impedance. It is advisable to use impedance simulation software tools to achieve this requirement.
*   If using an external antenna connector, place it close to the RF pin.
*   Ground plane optimization is critical for certain antenna types, such as monopoles.
*   GND traces used for RF path return must be directly connected to the GND plane and not treated as thermal reliefs.
*   It is recommended that RF traces be routed in a curve rather than at a sharp 90 degrees.

In addition, with a commitment to making IoT easy, RAK offers a dedicated service for Antenna RF Design which includes PCB design, tuning, matching, and RF testing.

### Software

Download the latest RAK3172 WisDuo LoRaWAN Module firmware provided below. The RAK3172(L) and RAK3172(H) use the same firmware, and it will automatically detect the variant of the module being used.

The bin file contains only the application code. You will need the RAK DFU Tool to upload this file to the module.

The hex file contains both the bootloader and the application code. You need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to upload this.

**warning**
Uploading the .hex file via STM32CubeProgrammer will erase all configured data on the device.

RAK3172 uses UART2 serial pins to upload the latest firmware.

**NOTE**
RAK3172 should automatically go to BOOT mode when the firmware is uploaded via RAK DFU Tool or WisToolBox.

If BOOT mode is not initiated, you can manually send AT+BOOT command to start bootloader mode.

**warning**
There are RAK3172 devices loaded with old firmware versions which are not based on RUI3 (RAKwireless Unified Interface V3). These devices have v1.0.4 and below.

If the host microcontroller code is based on this old firmware, refer to the RAK3172 AT Command migration guide that explains in detail the few differences between the two AT commands set.
